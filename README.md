This is a bash script. 
It should work right off the box on macOS and Linux distros. 
It uses OpenSSL to secure your entries.

In order to use it, open your terminal and;
1- Use "cd your/download/location/" command to change your working directory.
2- Use "chmod +x RorschachsJournal.sh"    //(only required on the first use)
3- Use "./RorschachsJournal.sh"

The script should work on all folders.
If you move the script you will not see your older entries.
